    <p>Welcome to my Galvanize P2 Project. TRUFLIX is a basic Movie Database app created with Vue.js. I am utilizing vue-router to pull from two different endpoints, one for populating the full-list of the most popular movies (as seen on the homepage, and the second for fetching the details of each individual movie when the user clicks on a specific movie selection. Try it out!</p>
